# Summer-Research
The files included here are just the Kalman Filter code and the text files necessary to run it for 2 player tracking. For the pre-processing of getting coordinates from the video, I followed this tutorial with slight modifications at the end to create coordinates from the (dx,dy). https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/ 
In the process of creating this, I tried to make it as flexible as possible, so the matrix definitions as well as delt (change in time factor) are at the beginning of functions and mu/sigma are defined as global variables. I decided to do this for ease of manipulation to try different things with the code. The error number in the plot() function can also be subject to change if the l-2 norm is preferred, since the graphical output is in Euclidean space.
